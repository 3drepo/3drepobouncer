### Contributing
We very much encourage contributions to the 3D Repo project. Firstly, fork the desired repository and commit your modifications there. Once happy with the changes, you can generate a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and our team will integrate it upstream after a review.

Your pull requests should:

1. Follow the style of the existing code
2. One commit should just do one thing, and one thing only
3. Work in a branch assigned to a specific issue number, e.g. branch called "ISSUE_138"
4. Each commit message should be prefixed with the issue number, e.g. "#138 Fixing bug xyz..."
5. Rebase your branch against [upstream's master](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) so that we don't pull redundant commits
6. Sign our [3D Repo Individual CLA](https://gist.github.com/jozefdobos/e177af804c9bcd217b73) or if you are representing a legal entity, sign the [3D Repo Entity CLA](https://gist.github.com/jozefdobos/c7c4c1c18cfb211c45d2)
