3drepobouncer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/3drepo/3drepobouncer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/3drepo/3drepobouncer) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/3drepo/3drepobouncer/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/3drepo/3drepobouncer?branch=master)
=========

3DRepoBouncer is essentially the refactored 3DRepoCore and (parts of) 3DRepoGUI. It is a C++ library providing 3D Repo Scene Graph definition, repository management and manipulation logic as well as direct MongoDB databse access.

### Latest Releases
We always recommend using the [Latest stable release](https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer/releases). However, to access cutting-edge development versions, check out the [tags](https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer/tags).

### Contributing
We very much encourage contributions to the 3D Repo project. Firstly, fork the desired repository and commit your modifications there. Once happy with the changes, you can generate a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and our team will integrate it upstream after a review.

Your pull requests should:

1. Follow the style of the existing code
2. One commit should just do one thing, and one thing only
3. Work in a branch assigned to a specific issue number, e.g. branch called "ISSUE_138"
4. Each commit message should be prefixed with the issue number, e.g. "#138 Fixing bug xyz..."
5. Rebase your branch against [upstream's master](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) so that we don't pull redundant commits
6. Sign our [3D Repo Individual CLA](https://gist.github.com/jozefdobos/e177af804c9bcd217b73) or if you are representing a legal entity, sign the [3D Repo Entity CLA](https://gist.github.com/jozefdobos/c7c4c1c18cfb211c45d2)

## API Documentation
Doxygen documentation can be found [here](http://3drepo.github.io/3drepobouncer/doc/html/)

Dependencies
------------
3DRepoBouncer relies on the following libraries:
* [Boost Library v1.55.0 - v1.58.0](http://www.boost.org/)  
See also [pre-built binaries for Windows](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/)
and [modular Boost](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/ModularBoost)
on [GitHub](https://github.com/boostorg)
* [Mongo CXX Driver Legacy v1.0+](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver)
See [3D Repo guide for compiling MongoDB](https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer/wiki/Compiling-MongoDB-CXX-Driver)
* [3D Repo ASSIMP library fork](https://github.com/3drepo/assimp)
See [3D Repo guide for compiling ASSIMP](https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer/wiki/Compiling-ASSIMP)
* [3D Repo IFCOpenShell Fork](https://github.com/3drepo/IfcOpenShell)
This relies on 3D Repo's fork of [OCCT](https://github.com/3drepo/occt)

To compile and install the library, the following are used:
* [Python v2.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [CMAKE v2.8] (http://www.cmake.org/)
* A C++ compiler (GNU GCC v4.9+, [Visual Studio 12+](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx))

Compilation (Qt)
------------
See instructions at [https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer/issues/9#issuecomment-135727927](https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer/issues/9#issuecomment-135727927)

Compilation (Windows)
------------
Ensure Mongo CXX Driver, Boost and ASSIMP libraries are installed.

The following instruction is for compiling a 64bit library using Visual Studio 12's tools. Change the pathing/cmake option appropriately if you are using another version of Visual Studio or compiling with a different compiler.

In command line prompt:
set the following environmental variables to the directories of your installations:
* `$env:BOOST_ROOT = path_to_boost`
* `$env:BOOST_LIBRARYDIR = path_to_boost_libraries (i.e path_to_boost\lib64-msvc-12.0)` (NOT REQUIRED if libraries are in `$BOOST_ROOT/lib`) 
* `$env:MONGO_ROOT = path_to_mongo_cxx_driver`
* `$env:ASSIMP_ROOT = path_to_assimp`

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer.git`
2. Change directory: `cd 3drepobouncer`
3. Update CMake files: `python updateSources.py`
4. Create off-source build directory: `mkdir build`
5. Change directory: `cd build`
6. Configure build with CMAKE: `cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64" ../`
7. Build the library: `msbuild 3drepobouncer.vcxproj`

Compilation (Linux)
------------
Ensure Mongo CXX Driver, Boost and ASSIMP libraries are installed.

If the libraries are not installed in `/usr, /usr/local, /opt/local,` set the following environmental variables:
* `export BOOST_ROOT = path_to_boost`
* `export MONGO_ROOT = path_to_mongo_cxx_driver`
* `export ASSIMP_ROOT = path_to_assimp`

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer.git`
2. Change directory: `cd 3drepobouncer`
3. Update CMake files: `python updateSources.py`
4. Create off-source build directory: `mkdir build`
5. Change directory: `cd build`
6. Configure build with CMAKE: `cmake ../`
7. Build the library: `make`

Recompiling with changes
------------
Apart from the `CMakeLists.txt` at root level, every other cmake file is automatically generated. If you have moved/created any source/header files, please run `python updateSources.py` to update the `CMakeLists.txt` files within the subdirectories before compiling.

Do NOT modify any `CMakeLists.txt` files within src folder as any changes will be overwritten when `updateSources.py` is executed!
