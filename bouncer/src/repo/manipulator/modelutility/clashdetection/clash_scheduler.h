				/*
				* Goal of the scheduler is to order the narrowphase tests so that we only
				* load & pre-process each MeshNode once, but also that they are offloaded as
				* soon as possible to avoid running out of memory.
				* 
				* One way to express this is MIN->RMS([SPAN]), where SPAN is the differnce
				* between the first and last index of any MeshNode in the broadphase results.
				*
				* This is an NP-hard problem, so this object creates a best guess.
				*
				* It works by starting with the Mesh with the fewest references from set A.
				* Those potential colliders in Set B are also ordererd by their number of
				* references. This defines the first set of narrowphase tasks. We repeat the
				* process, starting from the first Mesh in the ordered set of B colliders
				* that still has outstanding narrowphase tasks.
				*
				* By moving through the Meshes with the fewest associated jobs first, they
				* can be unloaded as early as possible. By adding all jobs associated with
				* a particular mesh to the list contiguously, we ensure that at least one
				* Mesh is unloaded after each 'block'.
				*
				* This hopefully makes the algorithm robust to the worst case, which is that
				* of meshes alternating between Set A and Set B, laid out linearly and so
				* making the graph of all Meshes fully connected.
